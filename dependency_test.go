package coderig

// This compile-only dependency-surface probe covers both the completed rig
// migration and Task 34's context/hustle additions. It builds only when the
// planned core, inference, LLM, harness, and CLI APIs are all present through
// CodeRig's retained local replaces. It carries no test functions because its value
// is that the package cannot compile against a partial dependency rollout.
